I have 12 years' experience running product teams, speaking to users, and building great software that people love to use. I’ve coached product managers at all levels of seniority and experience, and I’ve delivered dozens of training sessions to product and development teams.

I spent two and a half years as the in-house product coach and product community lead at fast-moving health tech start-up Accurx, the communication platform used by nearly every GP surgery in England. I came to Accurx after three years as lead product manager at the UK’s largest charity Cancer Research UK, and four years as product manager for Top Gear and BBC Good Food at BBC Worldwide (now BBC Studios), and two years working in the product team for the international version of BBC iPlayer. Before that, I was a journalist, writer and editor for 10 years.

**Career coaching**
Are you looking for a promotion or trying to find that next role, or simply not sure what path you want your career to take? I’ll work with you to open up your horizons or identify your path

**Product coaching**
I can coach you one-to-one to improve your product thinking, decision-making, delivery ability or stakeholder skills.

If you’re looking for new frameworks, tools or techniques to increase your impact as a product manager, I can offer product mentoring as well

**Team coaching**
I can come to you and coach your team of product managers or your development team to build their muscles in decision-making, discovery and delivery

**Leadership and executive coaching**
I can coach you to get past your blockers, overcome obstacles and achieve your goals. I’ve worked at senior levels in large organisations and in startups and have advised and coached executives and heads of department

**CV reviewing and interview coaching**
I've reviewed thousands of CVs and interviewed hundreds of candidates. I can review your existing CV or build you one from scratch that will show the best of your skills and experience. I can coach you to better your interview performance and help you achieve your next role. From hundreds of interviews with jobseekers, I know what makes hiring managers sit up and listen
